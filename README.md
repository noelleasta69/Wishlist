# Project Submission Update – Collaborative Product Wishlist

Hi ,

I wanted to share a quick update regarding my submission for the **Collaborative Product Wishlist** project.

Due to my ongoing **university exams**, I couldn’t complete the frontend in time — however, I’m actively working on it and plan to finish it by **tomorrow**.

## ✅ Backend Status – Completed

The **backend is fully implemented** using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **TypeScript**, following proper architecture and clean coding practices.

### Features Implemented:

- ✅ **Modular routing** (separate folders for routes, controllers, middlewares, and validators)
- ✅ **User authentication** using JWT (register, login with hashed passwords)
- ✅ **Wishlist functionality** (create, edit, delete wishlists)
- ✅ **Product management** (add/edit/remove products with image URL, name, price)
- ✅ **Invite functionality** (real invite flow – not mocked)
- ✅ **Tracks who added each product** (via user–wishlist–product relation)
- ✅ **Zod validation** for request data
- ✅ **PostgreSQL + Prisma** for clean, type-safe database access
- ✅ All routes tested and working smoothly

## ⚙️ Frontend – In Progress

I'm now working on integrating this backend with a **modern, minimal frontend** using React.  
The UI will support:

- Sign up & login
- Creating and managing wishlists
- Adding/removing products
- Inviting collaborators
- Viewing contributor info (username/email)

I'll be completing the frontend functionality by **tomorrow**.

Thanks for your time and consideration.  
I really appreciate your understanding!

Best regards,
